Get excersize the fun way</div>

Gameplex GeoHiker provides a fun, interactive way to excersize by giving the user quests to complete in specific locations. The app picks an interesting nearby location for you to visit and will add a trophy to the trophies screen. When you clich the trophy, the quest screen appears, and displays several badges, you will earn these badges as you complete the activities next to each one (tap them for more info). Once all badges under a quest are completed, you recive a checkmark next to it's trophy.
	
As you complete the activities (Walking, running, fishing, swimming, etc) you level up in various skills on the app's skills page (Visit skills page with the star button on the home screen). you will also recive coins which you will eventually be able to use in the gameplex app store, as well as in the GeoHiker watchfaces store.
